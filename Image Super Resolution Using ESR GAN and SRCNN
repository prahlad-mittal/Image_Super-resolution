Image Super Resolution Using ESR GAN and SRCNN

1) ESR GAN - Output mainly deals with Pixel Restoration
2) SRCNN - Output mainly deals with Image resolution enhancement

According to the image priors, single-image super resolution algorithms can be categorized into four types â€“ prediction models, edge based methods, image statistical methods and patch based (or example-based) methods
